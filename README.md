1. HotDogProblem.java<br>
    Important: do not use packages; output files must not contain blank lines in the end.<br>
    <b>Precondition:</b><br>
      The "input1.txt" file contains two different integers separated with comma.<br>
      The "input2.txt" file contains integers separated with space.<br>
    <b>Task:</b><br>
    1) Read X and Y from "input1.txt" file<br>
    2) Go over integers from "input2.txt" file and:<br>
    - If integer can be divided by X print "Hot" in the "output.txt"<br>
    - If integer can be divided by Y print "Dog" in the "output.txt"<br>
    - If integer can be divided by both X and Y print "HotDog" in the "output.txt"<br>
    - Otherwise print the integer itself in the "output.txt"<br>
    <i>Results in "output.txt" file must be separated with space.</i><br>
    <b>Note:</b><br>
    <i>Check the "input1.txt", "input2.txt" and "output.txt" files in "Tests" tab for an example</i><br>

2. RewriteString.java<br>
    <b>Precondition:</b><br>
    The "input.txt" file contains not empty string in lower case<br>
    <b>Task:</b><br>
    1) Read string from the "input.txt" file<br>
    2) 2) Remove characters from the string that are repeated maximum number of times<br>
    3) If all characters are repeated the same number of times - keep the string as is<br>
    4) Print the result string to the "output1.txt" file<br>
    5) In the "output2.txt" file print each character of initial string and number of times it was repeated (in format "a:3"). These records must be separated with space and sorted by number of repetitions from greatest to lowest (if 2 characters have same number of repetitions - sort by character's code in ascending order).
